## Archetypes
**Archetypes** represent a character's physical and mental traits. They are not quantified; rather, **Archetypes** may be **Injured** or **Enhanced** which provide numerical penalties and bonuses. Adding together the Injuries and Enhancements for an Archetype will yield the **Archetype Modifier**:

> [!Info] Archetype Modifier = Archetype Enhancements - Archetype Injuries

^archetype-modifier

There are three Archetypes, detailed below:

> | Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
> | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | Acuity    | A character's mental ability. Governs skills which primarily require concentration and problem solving.                                                                 |
> | Dexterity | A character's ability to manipulate and perceive fine information. Governs skills which primarily require use of fine motor skills, balance, and hand-eye coordination. |
> | Strength  | A character's physical ability. Governs skills which primarily require physical power and endurance.                                                                    | 

## Skills
Skills represent a character's learned and trained ability to perform a specific action or utilize a tool:

> [!Abstract]- Skills

> - Hacking
> - Weapon Smithing
> - Accounting
> - Advertising
> - First Aid
> - Surgery
> - Engineering
> - Lawyering

Each skill has a score from 0 to 100 called an **Aptitude** which represents the average [[Decision Engine#How To Make A Challenge Roll|Challenge Difficulty]] a character would find hard - but not impossible - to complete on their own.

Becoming wounded causes Injuries which are temporary or permanent numerical penalties to an archetype. These Injuries in turn lower a character's ability to use skills associated with the archetype according to the [[#^bc8436|Skill Level]] equation.

| Challenge Roll | Difficulty Value Formula                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Skill Rolls    | Skill Level - Environmental Difficulty                 |
| Combat Rolls   | Skill Level - Range Penalty - Environmental Difficulty |
| Contest Rolls  | Result of Opponents Roll                               |
